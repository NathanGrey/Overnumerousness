# Overnumerousness
Description
You will be writing an interactive program which computes the average of three numbers. You'll use Visual Studio to create a new project, as well as Visual Studio to code, edit, and build this assignment.

Requirements:
Create a Visual Studio project. Naming convention for project: [yourlastname]_2
Create guessing_game.cpp file in the new project.
Project must build and compile without any errors.
Must meet runtime specifications.
Runtime Specifications:
Prompt the user to input three numbers.
Prompt the user whether they want to guess the average. User input should either be "y" for yes or "n" for no.
Prompt the user for their guess.
If the user's guess is correct, print a congratulatory message.
Otherwise, print a consoling message to the user along with the correct answer.
Otherwise print the average.
Two sample outputs from a program run:
Output1

            > Enter the 1st number:  4

            > Enter the 2nd number: 2

            > Enter the 3rd number:  3

            > Would you like to guess the average? y

            > What's your guess? 3

            > How did you do that? You must be a robot.

Output 2

            > Enter the 1st number:  4

            > Enter the 2nd number: 2

            > Enter the 3rd number: 6

            > Would you like to guess the average? n

            > The average is: 4

Helpful Tip

Hints:
Use cin for user input and cout for output to the console.
An average is the sum of a list of numbers divided by the number of numbers in the list.
Use the following as a template for guessing_game.cpp file:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void main()
{
// your code here
}
